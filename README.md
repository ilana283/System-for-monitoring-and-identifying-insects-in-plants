**Insect Detection System on Raspberry Pi Using YOLOv7**

This project develops a real-time insect detection system using a Raspberry Pi and YOLOv7 repository.
It helps home gardeners detect insects on houseplants, reducing pesticide use and improving plant health.
The system uses a YOLOv7 model trained on a custom dataset with Roboflow to capture video, detect insects, and log statistics in a CSV file.
